# Install a Desktop Environment

When installing a full desktop environment, most of them handle the audio server and other components automatically. Below is a brief guide to getting started with GNOME.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure your system is up to date:

```bash
sudo pacman -Syyu
```

### Required Packages

- **`gnome`**: This is the desktop environment itself.
- **`gnome-tweaks`**: A settings application for changing themes, fonts, cursors, and various other settings.
- **`gdm`**: The login manager (also called the window manager). This is the program where you enter your username and password and select the desktop environment.
- **`gst-libav`**: Provides multimedia codecs and enables video file previews in GNOME's file manager, Nautilus.
- **`pipewire-jack`**: Provides legacy JACK support for the modern PipeWire audio server.
- **`noto-fonts-emoji`**: Google’s Emoji Font, ensuring you don’t end up with missing character symbols.

To install these packages, run the following command:

```bash
sudo pacman -S gnome gnome-tweaks gdm gst-libav pipewire-jack noto-fonts-emoji
```

### If you have trouble with some missing Fonts, here is a list with the essentials:

- **`noto-fonts noto-fonts-emoji noto-fonts-cjk noto-fonts-extra`**: Essential for wide language coverage, supporting many scripts and special characters.
  
- **`ttf-source-code-pro`**, **`ttf-source-sans-pro`**, **`ttf-source-serif-pro`**: These fonts provide high-quality typefaces for Latin characters in monospace, sans-serif, and serif categories.

- **`ttf-adobe-source-han-sans-otc`** and **`ttf-adobe-source-han-serif-otc`**: Designed for East Asian languages (CJK), offering high-quality sans and serif font options for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters.

- **`ttf-hanazono`**: Covers historical CJK characters, ensuring compatibility with ancient scripts.

- **`ttf-liberation`**: Provides metric-compatible fonts for Arial, Times New Roman, and Courier New, which helps maintain layout consistency in documents created with these standard fonts.

- **`ttf-dejavu`**: Some games, especially by Valve, are designed with this font in mind. Installing it prevents tiny, hard-to-read fallback text by providing the correct font size.

### Keyboard Layout

If you are using a non-US keyboard layout, it’s advisable to change it with the following command. Logging in with a non-functional layout can be quite challenging:

```bash
sudo localectl set-keymap de-latin1
```

<br>

### Enable the Display Manager

Next, enable the autostart for the login manager (GDM):

```bash
sudo systemctl enable gdm
```

<br>

### Reboot

You are now ready to reboot into your new desktop environment!

```bash
sudo reboot
```
